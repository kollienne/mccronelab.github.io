We're officially open in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Hutch. 
It's still early days, and there's a lot to get set up yet.
Check back if you're interesting in virus evolution and/or Bayesian phylodynamics. 
Soon, we should have postings soon for students, postdocs, and developers, but it's never to early to get in touch.
