I am an Assistant Professor at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. 
My primary appointment is in the BBE program within the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Division. 
I  enjoy trying to wrap my head around new new ideas. 
Maybe that's why I like viral phylodynamics; there  seems to be endless fodder to grapple with. 
In the lab we develop and apply new and old methods to understand how virus evolve and spread in populations.  

Outside of the lab, I have a few hobbies...
I enjoying playing sports like running, baseball, and hockey, and perpetually wish I knew more about music. 
I play the trumpet, and at one point was not terrible.
Most of my leisure time now consumed by sharing these interests with my kids, and learning new ones.
