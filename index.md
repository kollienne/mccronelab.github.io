    excerpt: 'We study in virus evolution at all biological scales, and use large datasets to uncover how processes within infected hosts and across continents shape pathogen diversity and impact human health.
In the lab we use genomic sequencing, computational biology, and phylogenetics to decode past events and understand current trends in viral evolution and epidemiology. 
The McCrone lab is based in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, WA. We are always interested in new colloborations and team members.'
