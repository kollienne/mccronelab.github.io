    excerpt: 'We use large datasets to uncover how processes within infected hosts and across continents shape pathogen diversity and impact human health.
In the lab we rely on genomic sequencing, computational biology, and phylogenetics to decode past events and understand current trends in virus evolution and epidemiology. 
 If that sounds like fun get in touch! We are always interested in new collaborations and team members.'
